# Deep-Residual-COVID-Net

# A Novel Method for Detection of COVID-19 Cases Using Deep Residual Neural Network

In this study, a deep residual learning model is proposed for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The proposed model is developed to provide accurate diagnostics for multi-class classification (COVID vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia). Our model produced an average classification accuracy of 99.65% multi-class cases.

In this study, X-ray images obtained three different sources were used for the diagnosis of COVID-19. A COVID-19 X-ray image database was developed by a team of researchers from Qatar University, Doha, Qatar and the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh along with their collaborators from Pakistan and Malaysia in collaboration with medical doctors have created a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal and Viral Pneumonia images. In the current release, there are 219 COVID-19 positive images, 1341 normal images and 1345 viral pneumonia images (https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).
